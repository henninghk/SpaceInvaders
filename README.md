# Space-Invaders-CS-Console

(C# Console app + Space Invaders == Awesome Game) => TRUE!!!

This is a C# Console version of space-invaders. It works pretty well, the game is not finished yet but it's starting to take shape now. It is not a pleasure to play, because you can only press one key at a time and you are limited by the windows key-repeat time for you keystrokes to count. But i would say that it works pretty well.
